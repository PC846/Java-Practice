# Relearning Selenium with Java

My first experience with Selenium, a web testing/automation framework, was in my summer internship as a Software Developer. There I had to learn to use the framework using Ruby. I did learn enough Ruby to complete the tasks given to me throughout my internship, however I figured it would be better to widen my horizon and learn the framework with Java as well. 

I would like to showcase my growth with the framework and language here in case anyone is interested.
